don't have one, *Michelangelo* is my favorite painter, but will pick
*Raphael* ‧ ℗ick your one, bcoz in this exercise ve are going to draw ‧
Ά graph vith *n-vertices* is
[*given*](https://ioinformatics.org/files/ioi1989problem5.pdf),
and each vertex (BepTékc, *vex*, ***vtx***) has ***degree** 3*,
that is each *vex* has *3* neighbors, or *3* **adjacent** vertices
(*vtes*) ‧ 弋he problem is subdivided into *4* subsections :

  1. *vtχ* coorz and graph edges are given, and ve hafe to scale them
  appropriately, if necessary, and draw ze graph .
  2. Ħere a definition of *left* and **right** neighbors is presented and
  a   **ctrlseq**, consisting of initial ***two*** vtes and the letters ℒ
  and ℜ, from which the program has to figure the corresponding *walk* .
  3. つ*raw* ze walk .
  4. gìϔěń ⌇**tarting** and ending vtes, ve haaf to find the *minimum*
  path, draw it, and print the corresponding *ctrlseq* .

### Ŧurtle Ninja
**ℱ**or drawing the *Python* ***turtle*** module (requres *Tkinter*) is
used ‧ ℃oordinates are in the range *[-200, 200]* ‧ ℵere is how the
canvas looks like :

![canvas](pix/canvas.png)

₸he program reads from *stdin*, zo infut is placed in a text file and
then redirected ‧ Ⅎormat of the infut is as follows *(infut/cube)* :
```

A  120  -180
B  121   -23
C -46   -2
D -110  -139
E  177   21
F -164   58
G -62    165
H  157   151

```
**ℕew lines** and *spaces* are ignored ‧ Ƒirst number is the
*number of vtes*, followed by a list of ***vtx*** data: *(id, x, y)* ‧
seℭond number is the *number of edges*, followed by a list of
*unordered* **vtx** pairs: (*id*<sub>0</sub>, *id*<sub>1</sub>) ‧ Ȁnd last
two lines are the *control sequence* and *minimum* path
*starting/ending **vtes*** .

### ```graph.py < infut/cube```

**Ⴒ**asically there is nothing much to be discussed ⏩ for how to use
the *ninja* module there is the online
[*reference*](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html) ‧ ⿰⿱⿳
most challenging seems to be the fourth sub-problem, but here we use the
same approach as in the first *yoi*
[prob](https://github.com/neznajko/boxes), namely tree ***depth*** srch ‧
┳**his** time I've decided to make a *Screencast*, zo if you don't want
to install additional modules, but are curious to ʘʘ the program,
check out the *video* directory ‧ **ℋ**ere is the final frame ㋡
